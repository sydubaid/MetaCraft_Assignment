# LDA Topic Modeling Project

This project demonstrates how to perform **Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)** topic modeling on a text dataset using Python. The script preprocesses the dataset, trains an LDA model, and visualizes the topics using **pyLDAvis**.

## Project Overview

This project involves the following steps:
1. **Loading Dataset**: The dataset is loaded from a JSON file.
2. **Preprocessing Text**: The text is cleaned, tokenized, stop words are removed, and words are lemmatized.
3. **Topic Modeling**: LDA is used to identify topics within the documents.
4. **Visualization**: Topics are visualized interactively using pyLDAvis.

## Installation

Before running the script, make sure you have Python installed (preferably Python 3.6 or above).

### Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/repository-name.git
cd repository-name
```

### Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you don't have the `requirements.txt` file, you can install the necessary libraries manually:
```bash
pip install nltk gensim pyldavis
```

### Download NLTK data (if not already downloaded):
```python
import nltk
nltk.download('stopwords')
nltk.download('punkt')
nltk.download('wordnet')
```

## Usage

1. Place your dataset (in JSON format) in the project folder.
2. Run the `lda_model.py` script:
```bash
python lda_model.py
```

The script will:
- Preprocess the text data.
- Train an LDA model.
- Generate an interactive topic visualization.

The visualization will be saved as `lda_visualization.html`, and it will open in your default browser.

## Visualization

After running the script, the topics generated by LDA will be displayed interactively using pyLDAvis. You can explore the relationship between topics and terms and view the most significant words for each topic.

Open the `lda_visualization.html` file in your browser to explore the results.

## Dependencies

- **nltk**: For text preprocessing (tokenization, stop word removal, lemmatization).
- **gensim**: For training the LDA model.
- **pyLDAvis**: For visualizing the LDA topics interactively.
- **matplotlib**: For displaying additional visualizations.
